national_indicator_available: Organically farmed agricultural land                   

dns_indicator_definition: The indicator shows the share of total utilised agricultural area in Germany that is cultivated by organically managed farms subject to the control system regulated by the EU legislation on organic farming (Regulation (EC) No. 834/2007 and the implementing rules). It includes land that has been fully converted to organic management as well as areas still undergoing conversion.<sub> Text from the Indicator Report 2018</sub>                   

dns_indicator_intention: Organic farming preserves and protects natural resources to a particularly high degree. It has a range of positive effects upon nature, climate and the environment, and provides for the production of high quality food. For this reason, the proportion of organically farmed agricultural land should be 20&nbsp;% by 2030.<sub> Text from the Indicator Report 2018</sub>

content_and_progress: "Data on organic farming are collected by the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) and by the Federal Statistical Office.<br><br>The Federal Statistical Office uses various surveys to determine the amount of organically farmed land. The reference value for the proportional computation is the amount of utilised agricultural area determined annually as part of the land use survey. The utilised agricultural area includes all areas and sub-areas used for agricultural or horticultural purposes. Building and farmyard areas of agricultural holdings are therefore not included in the reference value.<br><br>The data collected by the BMEL include details of the amount of organically farmed land reported annually by the organic regulatory authorities of the Länder. The reporting date is 31 December of a year. All reports for a current year are accumulated no later than the reporting date. The data from the BMEL contain slightly higher values. Amongst others, this is due to the fact that areas without a cut-off threshold are related to all areas with a cut-off threshold. This means that very small areas are also included in the numerator when calculating the proportion, whereas only areas above a certain minimum size are taken into account in the denominator.<br><br>According to data from the Federal Statistical Office, the share of organically farmed land increased from 2.9&nbsp;% to 6.8&nbsp;% between 1999 and 2017. As a result, in 2017 this amounted to an area of 1.14 million hectares. The data from the BMEL indicate a slightly higher share of organically farmed land in total agricultural land due to the methodology employed. Consequently, the value for 2017 was 8.2&nbsp;% or 1.37 million hectares.<br><br>In recent years the amount of organically farmed land has increased further, but the annual percentage increase has eased, even stagnating between 2016 and 2017. If the trend continues at the level recorded, the target of reaching 20&nbsp;% of organically farmed agricultural land by 2030 will not be met.<br><br>Germany’s organically farmed land was used as follows in 2017: 55.9&nbsp;% as permanent pasture, 42.5&nbsp;% for arable land and 1.6&nbsp;% for other land. In contrast, the main focus of agriculture as a whole was on arable land (70.5&nbsp;%), while the share of permanent pasture was 28.3&nbsp;% and other land accounted for 1.2&nbsp;% of the total utilised agricultural area. According to the results of the 2016 farm structure survey, Bavaria held the largest share of organically farmed land among all Länder (around 23&nbsp;%), followed by Brandenburg (12&nbsp;%) and Baden-Württemberg (just under 12%). The conversion to organic farming is promoted to varying degrees by the individual Länder.<br><br>According to Eurostat statistics, a total area of 11.9 million hectares was organically farmed in the states of the EU-28 in 2016. In regards to the total utilised agricultural area in individual EU countries, the highest share of organic farming land was recorded in Austria (21.2&nbsp;%), followed by Sweden (18.3&nbsp;%), Estonia (18.0&nbsp;%), Italy (14.2&nbsp;%) and the Czech Republic (14.0&nbsp;%).<sub> Text from the Indicator Report 2018</sub>"
